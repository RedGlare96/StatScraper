# StatScraper
Scrapes stats from public pages of social media sites 

## Logging in to accounts 
Even if the pages are public some websites such as Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram will sometimes block access to the
page and provide a prompt to log in. Use the script **cookiegen.py** to log in to their respective accounts.
Just open the script and follow its instructions, you only need to log in once before the main script can
continue to use the logged in accounts.
